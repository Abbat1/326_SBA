Well this project was a wqy for us to indulge in the html, css and javascript skills we have developed over the past couple weeks. As we were working with bootsraps, we are now incorpering them into our projects, learning to access certain information across the web and making our webpages more personable amd creative. I also used a lot of css styling to organize the structure of the page, and div classes in my html to navigate easily when isolating a section of the DOM.
